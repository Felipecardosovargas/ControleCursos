/**
 * Unchecked exception thrown when a requested entity is not found in the system.
 * <p>
 * This exception indicates that an operation attempted to retrieve or manipulate an entity
 * (e.g., {@code Aluno}, {@code Curso}, {@code Matricula}) by its identifier or specific criteria,
 * but no matching entity could be found in the underlying data store or within the application's context.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As an unchecked exception (extending {@link RuntimeException}), it does not need to be
 * explicitly declared in method signatures or caught by calling code, making the API cleaner.
 * It typically signals a recoverable application state where the absence of an entity
 * is unexpected given the application's flow, but might be handled at a higher level
 * (e.g., by a global exception handler in a web application).
 * </p>
